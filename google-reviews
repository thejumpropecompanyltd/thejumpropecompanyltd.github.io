I wasn‚Äôt sure he would have time for me, as I don‚Äôt have a social media presence, but that is not the case. He is patient and helps you build on your skills every week. He‚Äôs been very flexible with schedule changes that come up and has a solid understanding of skill development, which includes such things as timing, hand placement, and leg position. There are still many things I want to learn, but I feel like I have a solid foundation and increased confidence to take them on."

Where he is in the UK and I am in the US we needed to be virtual for our coaching sessions and I was impressed with how he was able to discern the issues that were holding me back. That goes to show his keen eye and ability to communicate to his clients. I had been jumping for over a year before I started having him as my coach and I made more progress over the course of six coaching sessions than I did in year. He helped with form and focus and I cannot recommend him enough if you are looking to advance your jump rope journey."

I mostly do my jumps over a mat, but occasionally I've jumped on concrete and the beads hold on to their structure. My old rope which I bought in a supermarket quickly tore apart after one month of jumping. I am a beginner with less than a year experience with jumping, but this rope helped me tremendously with learning new moves with freestyle because you can definitely feel the rope swing feedback. Overall highly recommend, no regrets."

I needn‚Äôt have given it a second thought as everybody was so friendly, Chris has a fantastic sense of humour which immediately put me at ease and made me want to try all the releases he was teaching us and not worry about needing improvement as his feedback was so constructive and completely made sense and was delivered in the most friendly way possible which I know sounds a bit strange but I‚Äôm somebody who takes feedback really badly but instead of making me want to give up, I wanted to prove to myself (and Chris!) that I could do it. It didn‚Äôt matter that I‚Äôm a beginner as the coaches were so good at giving us things to do which were completely within our skill range, whilst also extending our knowledge and encouraging us to try new things.

My Rhythm was out of control, I jumped too high, I just felt heavy footed you could say. I could barely do 3 in a row. I borrowed one of their skipping rope and practised, got better. Still not to a level where I want to be, I want to be able to skip like Boxers do. Last week my skipping rope handle broke and then the rope ripped. I was annoyed, so I came across your site and read how how much skipping meant to Chris, the passion he had, and the effort he went to make a quality skipping rope.
