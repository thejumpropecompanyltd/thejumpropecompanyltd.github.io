I wasn‚Äôt sure he would have time for me, as I don‚Äôt have a social media presence, but that is not the case. He is patient and helps you build on your skills every week. He‚Äôs been very flexible with schedule changes that come up and has a solid understanding of skill development, which includes such things as timing, hand placement, and leg position. There are still many things I want to learn, but I feel like I have a solid foundation and increased confidence to take them on."

Chris is friendly, always patient and happy to tailor and adapt as things progress. I love the mix of theory and practical application of what we're learning. If you're interested in stepping up your jump rope / skipping game, definitely get in touch with Chris to learn more!"

I'm eager to start again but unfortunately am at the mercy of working full time and my 1 year old son, who was the reason I had to stop my sessions in the first place üòÑ I miss my jump rope sessions!! Chris is fab-u-lous and I highly recommend him üòä"

Where he is in the UK and I am in the US we needed to be virtual for our coaching sessions and I was impressed with how he was able to discern the issues that were holding me back. That goes to show his keen eye and ability to communicate to his clients. I had been jumping for over a year before I started having him as my coach and I made more progress over the course of six coaching sessions than I did in year. He helped with form and focus and I cannot recommend him enough if you are looking to advance your jump rope journey."

Just small adjustments to my form was so helpful and he could spot those areas so quickly! Chris is excellent at explaining things and using relatable analogy‚Äôs. The sessions were fun and challenging and I felt so successful after each session. Thank you Chris and I‚Äôll be working with you again soon!"

If you are just starting out jump rope or stuck and no progression, and considering a Coach then Chris is your guy üôåüèº his tricktionary - an online resource of jump rope tricks - is excellent and provided free of charge. He gives a lot to the jump rope community and has his own jump rope company which sell‚Äôs excellent quality jump ropes at reasonable price. The workshops are excellent too."
