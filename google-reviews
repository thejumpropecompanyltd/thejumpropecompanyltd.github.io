I wasn‚Äôt sure he would have time for me, as I don‚Äôt have a social media presence, but that is not the case. He is patient and helps you build on your skills every week. He‚Äôs been very flexible with schedule changes that come up and has a solid understanding of skill development, which includes such things as timing, hand placement, and leg position. There are still many things I want to learn, but I feel like I have a solid foundation and increased confidence to take them on.",

My old rope which I bought in a supermarket quickly tore apart after one month of jumping.
