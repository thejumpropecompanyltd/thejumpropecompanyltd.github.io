These are typically performed with a double rotation as a stylistic choice."

This is the most biomechnically-efficient way to perform a Mic Release and so its recommended that beginners learn this first before exploring other types."

True consecutives have no Opens in between the skills at all (e.g Cross > Cross > Cross), whereas semi-consecutives have one Open in between the skills (e.g. Cross > Open > Cross > Open > Cross).
